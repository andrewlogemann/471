# About the Course
In this course, we will explore the practice of reading in American culture. As we consider our current reading practices, their relationship to those of the past, and their implications for those of the future, we will discover much about the affiliation between reading and technology. We will begin by thinking about the history of this association, investigating the extent to which nearly everything about a book, from the alphabet used to form its words, to the printing press used to mass-produce it; to the scroll, codex, or digital file upon which it is printed, is a technology. We will also take note of the strategies through which writers and their texts enable, resist, or offer commentary upon the symbiotic relationship between reading and technology. After anchoring ourselves in this history, we will use the insights we glean from the past to articulate our present understandings about the value of books and reading, and to consider the ways in which technological innovations may change our future relationships to these things. Among the questions that will guide our inquiry are the following: What is the relationship between reading and our culture of information? How is reading related to cognition? Are digital technologies changing the way we read and study literature? What do we gain, and what do we lose, when we employ different reading practices? What does the future hold for the practice of reading in the digital age? In this course, we will read works of literature alongside the work of historians, literary and cultural critics, and others as we generate our own insights about the past, present, and future of reading. In so doing, we will practice applying humanities research skills to real-world problems, and developing our ability to think critically about cultural ideas and practices.

# Student Learning Outcomes
After you’ve successfully finished this course, you’ll be able to:

1. Analyze written materials from a variety of genres.
2. Evaluate key moments in the development of the book as a technological form.
3. Compare the affordances of different forms of information technology (paper, books, screens, and so on).
4. Apply critical thinking skills to questions about reading practices and their relationship to information theory, cognition, and/or technology.
5. Write clearly for a specified audience, using conventions of format and structure appropriate to your rhetorical situation.

# Course Structure and Approach

This is a hybrid course that will combine traditional classroom instruction with digital/online elements and assignments. All digital/online activities are asynchronous, which means that you do not need to be online at a set time of day. You do, however, need to complete your assignments according to firm deadlines. I have organized our material into five units: Unit 1 – Reading and Information; Unit 2 – Reading in Three Dimensions; Unit 3 - Reading and/with/on Machines; Unit 4 – Reading Futures; Unit 5 – The Future of Reading: Final Projects. Each unit will afford you a sequence of opportunities to dig deeply into the topic and to demonstrate your learning. There is also an introductory unit that orients you to the course, ensures you have the needed technology skills to succeed in the course, and introduces you to your classmates.

# Assignment Options and Grading (How You’ll Earn Your Grade)

A	900-1000+ pts.
B	800-899 pts.
C 	700-799 pts.
D	600-699 pts.
F	599 pts. and below

# Assignments
1.	Blog Posts: Each week in this course, you’ll have an opportunity to blog about our assigned readings. Far from being a mere supplement to our course, the blog will be "the required reading that we write ourselves” and one (of the many) ways we will consider the concepts of our course together. You should think of this class not as meeting once a week but as an ongoing conversation that is active all semester. Your blog posts should be at least 300 words long, and respond directly to the week’s readings. You might consider historical or critical questions raised by one or more of the week’s readings, connect this week’s reading to previous reading in the course, pose an insightful question about the reading and then seek to answer your own question, or respond to another student’s post. In keeping with a common convention of good blog writing, your posts should include at least one rhetorically useful image or media clip that illustrates – rather than trivializes – the point you are trying to make. You should include a reference to the source of the image or media clip (and context, if necessary), as well. Instructions for finding and citing images are available on our Wordpress site. Blog posts are due on Mondays by 11:59 p.m. You cannot submit your weekly posts late, or make up for missed posts later in the semester. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

2.	Blog Commenting: Your comments on our course blog should engage in a conversation in some meaningful way. More than just agreeing or disagreeing with the original writer, a good comment will be substantive and reflective, explaining why you agree or disagree with the writer, or describing the questions/issues/associations the writer’s post raises for you. The best comments will add depth by asking a good question, or referring to another passage from the week’s reading that complicates the writer’s ideas, or connects what the writer is saying with another blog post from the class. You will earn 5 points for each substantive comment you make, up to a maximum of 15 points per week. Comments are due by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesdays. You cannot submit your weekly blog comments late, or make up for missed comments later in the semester.

3.	Digital Discussion Starter Post: Each week, one student volunteer will write a post (a shorter version of Professor Logemann’s weekly Provocation post) to begin a conversation about the week’s readings. The student writing the discussion starter post should begin by reading all of the blog posts from earlier in the week, as well as attending to the conversation in class on Wednesday and the comments on the blog posts. A good discussion starter post will not simply reiterate these conversations from earlier in the week, but will build on them and take us somewhere new. Good strategies for doing this well include: noting common themes from the posts and class discussion, noting unanswered questions from the posts and class discussion, pointing us back to passages in the reading that haven’t yet gotten much attention during the week, etc. These discussion starters should be 400-500 words long, and are due by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesdays. To sign up to write one of the Digital Discussion Starter Posts this semester, please visit our Wordpress site and click on the "Digital Discussion Starter Sign Up” link under "Quick Reference Links.” This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

4.	Digital Discussion Participation: Discussion assignments accomplish several different things in this course. First, they provide an opportunity for you to get to know and learn from your fellow students. They let you see the diversity of different viewpoints on the issues we’re discussing each week, while also encouraging you to explore our course concepts in relation to your own life. Lastly, discussions encourage you to think about material in ways that make it more memorable and easier to comprehend.

Research shows that students who participate in discussions earn better grades. It’s important, therefore, that you participate frequently and put thought into what you post. Research also tells us that communicating online creates some concerns that we wouldn’t normally have in a face-to-face discussion. Online, what you say tends to come across as more negative or critical than it would in a regular conversation, even when you’re just trying to joke around. It’s also easy to treat someone more harshly than you would normally, due to the lack of nonverbal signals, expressions, and so forth. Therefore, in this class, I want you to make a special effort to make sure that you treat each other with respect and kindness in your online communications. Feel free to disagree with one another (and with me!), but be sure that you are criticizing the idea and not the person. I reserve the right to delete posts and comments that are insulting, disparaging toward particular groups of people, or otherwise damaging to our class community.

Digital discussion participation will work like this: Each week, one student will kick off a conversation about the week’s reading and ideas by means of a Digital Discussion Starter post on our course blog. In the form of comments underneath the discussion starter’s post, your comments will engage in the conversation in some meaningful way. To receive full credit for digital discussion participation, you should post at least one substantive comment of your own, and reply to at least two other people. This is the minimum requirement, but you’re welcome to participate in the discussion thread as often as you’d like. Contributions to digital discussions are due on Thursdays by 11:59 p.m. You cannot submit contributions to a digital discussion late, or make up for missed contributions later in the term.

5.	Weekly Wrap-Up Post: As with the Digital Discussion Starter Post assignment, the student writing the Weekly Wrap-Up Post will have read the blog posts on Monday, paid attention to the blog comments on Tuesday, the class discussion on Wednesday, and the Digital Discussion on Thursday. The goal of the wrap-up post is to reflect the class’s thinking about the week’s readings and ideas. A good wrap up post will present the major themes of the week’s discussion and highlight unanswered questions that we should keep in mind for future weeks. These unanswered questions might even inspire research projects later in the semester. These discussion wrap-up posts should be 400-500 words long, and are due by 11:59 p.m. on Fridays. To sign up to write one of the Weekly Wrap-Up Posts this semester, please visit our Wordpress site and click on the "Weekly Wrap-Up Sign Up” link under "Quick Reference Links.” This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

Research Process

9.	Research Essay – Proposal: For the research essay proposal you will write a 400-500 word description of both (1) the literary issue you plan to address in your research essay (again, an issue something that is clearly full of significance in a work of literature, but is not directly explained), and (2) the critical conversation related to this interpretive issue that you plan to engage. This proposal should make clear to the reader which literary text you plan to analyze, the research sources on which you intend to draw, and the question you will pose. I encourage you to consider expanding one of your blog posts or explication posts from earlier in the term into a full-fledged research paper. If you take this route, be sure to mention it in your proposal, and focus on how you will be developing your original argument. The research proposal is due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the Schedule of Readings and Assignments below. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your proposal to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

10.	Research Essay – First Draft: First drafts of the research essay will be due during Unit 5. Your first draft will be graded for completeness, but not for quality (that is, you will earn points for having done it, but I will not grade your performance in argumentation, grammar and spelling, MLA style, etc. until the final draft). I will be happy to discuss it with you during my office hours, or via Skype, if you would like input or assistance. To earn full credit for completing a first draft, your draft should include all of the required elements of the final draft – it should be at least 8 pages long, it should engage with both a literary text and research sources, it should cite these sources in MLA style, and it should include a Works Cited page. The first draft of your research essay is due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the Schedule of Readings and Assignments below.

11.	Research Essay – Peer Review Participation: During Unit 5 you will have the opportunity to give and receive feedback on essay drafts. I will provide questions for structuring this feedback and earning the possible points for completing this assignment. The peer review comments on two of your classmates’ research essays are due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the Schedule of Readings and Assignments below.

12.	Research Essay – Final Draft: You will write an 12-15 page (double-spaced) argument addressing a significant issue/question related to any one of the literary texts on our course syllabus. The introduction to your essay should pose the question or issue that your essay will address and engage your reader’s interest in it. Within your essay, you will join in conversation with other scholars who have addressed your interpretive issue. Your proposed answer to this question (summarized in a single sentence) will serve as the thesis statement for your paper. An important note: this course affords you a range of options for demonstrating your learning, and gives you the freedom to select the assignments and assessments you’d like to complete throughout the term. The final draft of the research essay is the one exception: you cannot pass this course if you do not write a research essay. If you wish, you may opt out of the other elements of the research process: you can skip writing a proposal, avoid writing a first draft, or elect not to participate in our peer review process (though I hope you won’t – I’ve designed these activities carefully to help you become a better writer in this course!). The final draft of your research essay is due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the Schedule of Readings and Assignments below. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your essay to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.
