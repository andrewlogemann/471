# About the Course
In this course, we will explore the practice of reading in American culture. As we consider our current reading methods, their relationship to those of the past, and their implications for those of the future, we will discover much about the affiliation between reading and technology. We will begin by thinking about the history of this association, investigating the extent to which nearly everything about a book, from the alphabet used to form its words, to the printing press used to mass-produce it; to the scroll, codex, or digital file upon which it is printed, is a technology. We will also take note of the strategies through which writers and their texts enable, resist, or offer commentary upon the symbiotic relationship between reading and technology. After anchoring ourselves in this history, we will use the insights we glean from the past to articulate our present understandings about the value of books and reading, and to consider the ways in which technological innovations may change our future relationships to these things. Among the questions that will guide our inquiry are the following: What is the relationship between reading and our culture of information? How is reading related to cognition? Are digital technologies changing the way we read and study literature? What do we gain, and what do we lose, when we employ different reading practices? What does the future hold for the practice of reading in the digital age? In this course, we will read works of literature alongside the work of historians, literary and cultural critics, and others as we generate our own insights about the past, present, and future of reading. In so doing, we will practice applying humanities research skills to real-world problems, and developing our ability to think critically about cultural ideas and practices.

# Student Learning Outcomes
After you’ve successfully finished this course, you’ll be able to:

1. Analyze written materials from a variety of genres.
2. Evaluate key moments in the development of the book as a technological form.

# Course Structure

This is a hybrid course that will combine traditional classroom instruction with digital/online elements and assignments. All digital/online activities are asynchronous, which means that you do not need to be online at a set time of day. You do, however, need to complete your assignments according to firm deadlines. Our course Wordpress site, where you will complete your blog posts, digital discussions, and other assignments this semester, is available here: http://eng471.logemann.io.

# Assignments and Assessment

## Blog Posts (30%)
Each week in this course, you’ll have an opportunity to blog about our assigned readings. Far from being a mere supplement to our course, the blog will be ["the required reading that we write ourselves"](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/6) and one (of the many) ways we will consider the concepts of our course together. You should think of this class not as meeting once a week but as an ongoing conversation that is active all semester. Your blog posts should be at least 500 words long, and respond directly to the week’s readings. You might consider historical or critical questions raised by one or more of the week’s readings, connect this week’s reading to previous reading in the course, pose an insightful question about the reading and then seek to answer your own question, or respond to another student’s post. In keeping with a common convention of good blog writing, your posts should include at least one rhetorically useful image or media clip that illustrates -- rather than trivializes -- the point you are trying to make. You should include a reference to the source of the image or media clip (and context, if necessary), as well. Instructions for finding and citing images are available on our Wordpress site. Blog posts are due on Mondays by 11:59 p.m. You cannot submit your weekly posts late, or make up for missed posts later in the semester. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site. **I will drop your four lowest grades for this assignment; this means your best ten blog posts this semester will count toward your final grade in this course.**

## Participation and Engagement
Participation and engagement assignments accomplish several different things in this course. First, they provide an opportunity for you to get to know and learn from your fellow students. They let you see the diversity of different viewpoints on the issues we’re discussing each week, while also encouraging you to explore our course concepts in relation to your own life. Lastly, discussions encourage you to think about material in ways that make it more memorable and easier to comprehend.

Research shows that students who participate in discussions earn better grades. It’s important, therefore, that you participate frequently and put thought into what you say/post. Research also tells us that communicating online creates some concerns that we wouldn’t normally have in a face-to-face discussion. Online, what you say tends to come across as more negative or critical than it would in a regular conversation, even when you’re just trying to joke around. It’s also easy to treat someone more harshly than you would normally, due to the lack of nonverbal signals, expressions, and so forth. Therefore, in this class, I want you to make a special effort to make sure that you treat each other with respect and kindness in your online communications. Feel free to disagree with one another (and with me!), but be sure that you are criticizing the idea and not the person. I reserve the right to delete posts and comments that are insulting, disparaging toward particular groups of people, or otherwise damaging to our class community. In this course, you will have three types of participation/engagement assignment: blog commenting, in-class participation, and digital discussion participation.

### Blog Commenting (15%)
Your comments on our course blog should engage in a conversation in some meaningful way. More than just agreeing or disagreeing with the original writer, a good comment will be substantive and reflective, explaining why you agree or disagree with the writer, or describing the questions/issues/associations the writer’s post raises for you. The best comments will add depth by asking a good question, or referring to another passage from the week’s reading that complicates the writer’s ideas, or connects what the writer is saying with another blog post from the class. You will earn 5 points for each substantive comment you make, up to a maximum of 15 points per week. Comments are due by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesdays. You cannot submit your weekly blog comments late, or make up for missed comments later in the semester. **I will drop your three lowest grades for this assignment; this means your best ten weeks of blog commenting this semester will count toward your final grade in this course.**

## In-Class Participation (15%)
Because this is a seminar course, your comments serve a crucial role in the classroom experience. Discussion is one of the best ways to clarify your understandings and learn to build arguments; it’s important, therefore, that you participate frequently and put thought into your preparation. To help you do this in a structured way, I recommend that you get in the habit of coming to class with two questions about the reading, and two passages that struck you as particularly significant/interesting/perplexing. I will keep track of your participation in our classroom discussions and grade your performance at the end of each quad. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult regularly to make sure your participation includes all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

## Digital Discussion Participation (15%)
Digital discussion participation will work like this: Each week, one student will kick off a conversation about the week’s reading and ideas by means of a Digital Discussion Starter post on our course blog. In the form of comments underneath the discussion starter’s post, your comments will engage in the conversation in some meaningful way. To receive full credit for digital discussion participation, you should post at least one substantive comment of your own, and reply to at least two other students. This is the minimum requirement, but you are welcome to participate in the discussion thread as often as you’d like. Contributions to digital discussions are due on Thursdays by 11:59 p.m. You cannot submit contributions to a digital discussion late, or make up for missed contributions later in the term. **I will drop your three lowest grades for this assignment; this means your best ten weeks of digital discussion contributions this semester will count toward your final grade in this course.**

## Class Leadership (5%)

### Digital Discussion Starter Post
Each week, one of you will write a post (a shorter version of my weekly Provocation post) to begin a conversation about the week’s readings. The student writing the discussion starter post should begin by reading all of the blog posts from earlier in the week, as well as attending to the conversation in class on Wednesday and the comments on the blog posts. A good discussion starter post will not simply reiterate these conversations from earlier in the week, but will build on them and take us somewhere new. Good strategies for doing this well include: noting common themes from the posts and class discussion, noting unanswered questions from the posts and class discussion, pointing us back to passages in the reading that haven’t yet gotten much attention during the week, etc. These discussion starters should be 500 words long, and are due by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesdays. You will be invited to sign up for this assignment in class during Week 2. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

### Weekly Wrap-Up Post
As with the Digital Discussion Starter Post assignment, the student writing the Weekly Wrap-Up Post will have read the blog posts on Monday, paid attention to the blog comments on Tuesday, the class discussion on Wednesday, and the Digital Discussion on Thursday. The goal of the wrap-up post is to reflect the class’s thinking about the week’s readings and ideas. A good wrap up post will present the major themes of the week’s discussion and highlight unanswered questions that we should keep in mind for future weeks. These unanswered questions might even inspire research projects later in the semester. These discussion wrap-up posts should be 500 words long, and are due by 11:59 p.m. on Fridays. You will be invited to sign up for this assignment in class during Week 2. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your post to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Wordpress site.

## Final Project (20%)

### Proposal
*Please see "Final Draft," below, for a full description of the final project.* Proposals for the final project will be due during Week 13. For the research essay proposal you will write a 400-500 word description of both (1) the question/issue you plan to address in your project, and (2) the critical conversation related to this question/issue that you plan to engage. I encourage you to consider expanding one of your blog posts from earlier in the semester into a full-fledged final project. If you take this route, be sure to mention it in your proposal, and focus on how you will be developing your original argument. The research proposal is due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the schedule below. You will submit your proposal electronically via Blackboard – to do so, login to our Blackboard site, click on the "Final Project" link, click on the "Proposal" link, and upload your file. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your proposal to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Blackboard site.

### First Draft
*Please see "Final Draft," below, for a full description of the final project.* First drafts of the final project will be due during Week 15. Your first draft will be graded for completeness, but not for quality (that is, you can earn points for having done it, but I will not grade your performance in argumentation, grammar and spelling, etc. until the final draft). To earn full credit for completing a first draft, your draft should include all of the required elements of the final draft – it should be 10-12 pages long, it should articulate a clear question/issue, it should engage with at least eight academic research sources, it should cite these sources in MLA style, and it should include a Works Cited page. Please underline your thesis statement (your main claim or argument), which should appear in your first paragraph. The first draft of your final project is due by 11:59 p.m. on the date indicated in the schedule below. You will submit your essay electronically via Blackboard – to do so, login to our Blackboard site, click on the "Final Project" link, click on the "First Draft" link, and upload your file. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your first draft to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Blackboard site.

### Peer Review Participation
*Please see "Final Draft," below, for a full description of the final project.* During Week 15 you will have the opportunity to give and receive feedback on essay drafts. I will provide questions for structuring this feedback.

### Roundtable Participation
*Please see "Final Draft," below, for a full description of the final project.* During Week 16, our class session will be devoted to a roundtable conversation about the future of reading. Drawing on the research and thinking you have done for your final project, we will try to settle on the most important questions/issues that will shape the future of reading in the years to come. You should be prepared to talk about your project and what you are learning during this roundtable. This will also be an opportunity to engage with other students' projects and to draw some conclusions about the topics we have discussed throughout the semester. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your first draft to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Blackboard site.

### Final Draft
For our culminating project in this course, you will complete a final project that makes an argument about the most important question/issue necessary for understanding the future of reading. Drawing on our reading, class conversations, and your own original research, you will explain your question/issue and persuade your audience that this question/issue is vital for considering the evolving role of reading in contemporary culture. In addition to revisiting our reading from the semester, I encourage you to return to our course blog as you search for topics for this final project. Many of your posts this semester could serve as prewriting for this larger project. Feel free to take up one of your ideas from earlier in the semester and develop it into a topic for this project. As you look back through the blog, you might also find inspiration from a post written by another student. If this is the case, you can take someone else’s idea (with proper acknowledgement, of course) and develop it into your own topic for this final project, instead. But don’t feel limited by our previous blog writing; if you’d like to explore a new topic, you can do that, as well.

For many of you, the final project will take the form of a 10-12 page (double-spaced) research essay. If you take this route, the introduction to your essay should pose the question/issue that your essay will address and engage your reader’s interest in it. Within your essay, you will join in conversation with at least eight other sources (scholars, critics, artists, etc.) who have addressed your question/issue. Your proposed answer to this question (summarized in a single sentence) will serve as the thesis statement for your paper.

Others of you may wish to consider an alternative format to the traditional research essay for this final project. I'm open to this. If you have a creative idea for exploring a question/idea about the future of reading, please let me know. Alternative formats for the final project must receive my approval before you write a proposal.

The final draft of your final project is due on the date indicated in the schedule below. You will submit your project electronically via Blackboard -- to do so, login to our Blackboard site, click on the "Final Project" link, click on the "Final Draft" link, and upload your file. This assignment will be assessed according to a grading rubric, which you should consult before submitting your essay to make sure you have included all of the required elements. A copy of the rubric is available on our course Blackboard site.

# Course Policies  

## Late Work
All assignments should follow MLA guidelines. Writers who neglect these basic issues of formatting can expect to be penalized. Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the date indicated unless I specify otherwise. Assignments handed in at any time after the specified due date will be penalized by 5% for each day late, including weekends. Note that technology failure (such as a computer crash or a lost file) is never a valid excuse for a late assignment. Additionally, I will not accept assignments submitted more than one week late.

## Absences
You are permitted one (1) absence ("personal day"), no questions asked, without detriment to your grade; subsequent absences, however, will each lower your overall course grade by five percent. Excessive absence can result in failing this course. If you become ill or the victim of emergency circumstances, please let me know as soon as possible and keep me informed; I am willing to work with you to achieve a reasonable accommodation in such situations, but I can only do so with advance notice and regular communication.

## Extensions
No extensions will be given except in extreme (and verifiable) circumstances. These circumstances include reasons of health and extenuating circumstances, such as death of a family member.

## Accommodations
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Academic Support Center (ASC) as soon as possible. ASC staff is available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the sooner we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

## Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty is regarded as a major violation of both the academic and spiritual principles of this community and may result in a failing grade or suspension. Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism (see "Plagiarism" in the *Student Handbook*), cheating (whether in or out of the classroom), and abuse or misuse of library materials when such abuse or misuse can be related to course requirements.

## Library Resources
Students are responsible to obtain any library resources assigned for this course. Questions about library resources should be directed to librarians in the Jenks Library. Librarians are available to assist you from the library reference desk, by e-mail at library@gordon.edu, or by phone (978) 867-4878.

## Final Exam Policy
You have a final exercise during the assigned Final Exam Period. It is the College’s policy that an individual professor may not, for any reason, allow any student to take a final examination at any time other than that assigned by the Registrar. Accordingly, please do not ask me for permission to be excused from our Final Exam Period, as I do not have the authority to reschedule this course requirement.

## Email 
With the exception of holidays and weekends, I respond to your emails within twenty-four hours.
